This is a single page application based on AngularJS framework and HTML5 IndexedDB. It manages a simple local database, to which users can add, remove, search and list in pages.

One tip: All the photos must be kept in photos/ directory. When you create a new slide, only images under that directory can be selected. It's just a html app, isn't it?

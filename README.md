This is a single page application based on AngularJS framework and HTML5 IndexedDB. It manages a simple local database, to which users can add, remove, update, search and list records.

Thanks to IndexedDB, we can maintain a offline DB now. No Application Server, no DB server, all we need to run this DB is just a browser. 

About <strong>browser compatibility</strong>, all sane browsers support HTML 5 (especially IndexedDB, of course) are fine, but <strong>Chrome</strong> is highly recommended because I only included webkit properties for some CSS animation effects. 

Safari? No. It does NOT support IndexedDB, at this moment.

<strong>One tip:</strong> All the photos must be kept in photos/ directory. When you create a new slide, only images under that directory can be selected. It's just a html app, isn't it?
